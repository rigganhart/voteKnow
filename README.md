Front End Build System:

   Install npm dependencies listed in package.json from command line:
   
            cd voteKnow 
            npm install
   
   All work should be in the frontend directory:
   
            cd frontend
    
   Run gulp in the frontend directory to output to public directory. This watches for any changes and will throw errors if something is not right:
   
             gulp
